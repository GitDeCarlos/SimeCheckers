# SimeCheckers
Checkers, but the pieces are funny little slime sprites.

Note: This is a farely old program I wrote a few years, looking at the source code may or may not result in at least a little bit of cringe.
Just download the .jar file and run it, the file should start as intended.

Missing features:
* Forced Jump
* Double Jump
* Restart Game
* Save/Open Game
